Information about scripts:
* NeuralNetwork_Class.py - class with my neural network code for classification

* example_nnclassification.py - shows an example of how to use the NeuralNetwork_Class in NeuralNetwork_Class.py

* NeuralNetwork_Reg.py - class with my neural network code for regression. Example usage is included in the script.

* activations.py and costs.py - contains different activation functions, and the cost functions. Both the scripts are used in NeuralNetwork_Reg.py, while NeuralNetwork_Class.py only uses the activations.py

* logistic.py - contains my code for logistic regression on the mnist data

* example_logistic.py - shows an example of how to use the logistic regression function in the script logistic.py

* stochasticGD.py - contains my code for part a of the project, implementing sgd

* neededfunc.py - contains all basic functions
